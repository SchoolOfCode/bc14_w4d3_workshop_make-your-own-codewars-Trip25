/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!
The year is 3073. The world is in a state of chaos and robots have effectively taken over lol. 
The robots are all names after a programming language and they are all trying to take over the world. You are a robot named JavaScript and you want to be the sole leader and are trying to take over the world. 
You have a hitlist of all the other robots and their names. 

You need to write a function that will take in the list of robots and return the names of the robots that are not JavaScript. 
You need to return the names in an array. Good luck!
*/

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function getRobotNames(robots) {
    // Your code here



}































































































































































    //Don't you dare touch this line of code!
    //Also why are you even down here? You should be writing code! Way up there!

    // const otherRobots = robots.filter(robot => robot !== 'JavaScript');

    // return otherRobots;
    // }
